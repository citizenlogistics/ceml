ask signup re shoeless:
  Hello |his.first_name|. You are Level Zero. Lowly level zero.
  To advance to Level 1, please remove a shoe. Keep it off,
  and text back "shoeless".
tell signup:
  O ho! Well done |his.first_name|. Now the other players
  know you're in the game, too. But you're still a sad Level 1.
ask signup re game:
  To advance to Level 2, answer this question. What was your
  favorite game when you were 10 years old? Tell me now.
tell signup:
  Ah yes. |his.game| WAS an amazing game. You should try to play
  it again--sometime this week, perhaps?
  In the meantime you are but a mere Level 2. Let's see if we can do
  something about that. (You still have your shoe off, right?)
ask signup re friend:
  While you're texting... Pick someone in your address book you
  haven't talked to in a while. Send them an SMS
  just to say hello. Then tell me their first name.
tell signup:
  That was awfully nice of you to message |his.friend|
  Welcome to the amazing Level 3. You'll like it here. Stay awhile.
tell signup:
  Just kidding. Level 4 is way better than this. To get to
  Level 4, wait for an appropriate moment in Jane's talk
  and shout an encouraging "Amen!" Yes. Out loud.
ask signup re amen:
  If you're not the spiritual type, a forceful "YEAH!" will do.
  When you've accomplished your mission, text me "amen".
tell signup:
  Wow. I didn't think you had it in you. No one has ever gotten to
  Level 4 before. This is VERY exciting.
tell signup:
  If you get to Level 5, I'll give you a secret password. Tell it to
  Jane, and you'll get some very fancy loot.
ask signup re ovation:
  All you have to do is wait until the end of Jane's talk--and try to
  spark a standing ovation. Good luck! Text ovation afterward for your
  password.
tell signup:
  You did it! You are Level 5. You are AMAZING. The conquering hero of
  the entire audience! Now I can give you your password.
tell signup:
  Ask Jane to sign a copy of her book to Mr. Gamey McGameful. Of course,
  this will only work if she saw you standing in that ovation. You were
  standing, right?
